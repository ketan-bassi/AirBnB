## Overview of the company and report objectives

AirBnB Inc. (AirBnB) is an American company operating an online marketplace for lodging:
primarily vacation rentals and tourism activities. The company was founded in 2007 by Brian
Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk, and Joe Gebbia in San Francisco, California. Since then, it has
experienced extremely rapid growth all over the world and currently has 4+ million hosts,
6+ million listings, and over a billion guest arrivals all time (AirBnB, 2022a). The success of
AirBnB is largely due to its unique business model that is focused on providing its users an
open platform, free market, and affordability. AirBnB continues to disrupt the lodging industry,
and as the number of travellers is bound to steadily increase post the COVID-19 pandemic, the
company is likely to keep growing.
The purpose of this report is to explore an AirBnB dataset with a focus on 2 crucial variables:
price of a listing and rating of the host. More specifically, the prices and ratings in the United
States (US). The motivation behind this was the undeniable importance of the variables to the
host and the tenant. The price of a listing and the rating of the host are likely the first 2
things an individual considers when choosing their place of stay. Furthermore, as with most
online marketplaces, the listing with the highest rating and ”best” price is usually one of the first
options visible to the user (i.e. first result to show up from a search). The goal of the report
is to provide meaningful and useful insights surrounding prices and ratings for all current and
potential users of AirBnB.
